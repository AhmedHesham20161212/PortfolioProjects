# Portfolio Projects
This repository will hold all of the code and queries for projects I have done in addition to projects which I will finish in the future to become a Data Analyst.


# Data Analysis Projects


## Data Analysis and Data Wrangling with International Debt Statistics Using SQL
In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

We are going to find the answers to questions like:
- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

For this project, we will be using the International Debt Statistics dataset https://data.worldbank.org/products/ids


## Covid-19 Exploratory Data Analysis with Covid-19 Cases and Deaths Statistics Using SQL 
In this project, we are going to explore and look at the Covid-19 deaths data. The dataset contains information about number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in each location around the world starting from january 2,2022 in addition to data about vaccination and number of recovered cases.

Using SQL we are going to get the full picture of the situation from the beginning of the epidemic of Covid-19 and how the number of total cases and deaths changed in different locations across the world in addition to other important statistics.

First thing to do is splitting the original dataset and work on two datasets, the first one will have data about cases and deaths and the second one will have data abput vaccinations. 

We will try to know the top countries with the highest infection rates, highest death count and compare the number to population number and we will reveal the top days which have the most number of cases and deaths then we will break the data down by the continent to see the continent which has been affected the most and which one has been affected the least. 

We will track the number of vaccinations for each location around the world in addition to calculating the number of people that has been fully vaccinated in each country and their percentage from the total population then we will Show population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine in each country and determine the percentage from the total population.

For this project, we will be using the data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths


## Data Cleaning with Nashville Housing Data Using SQL
In this project, we are going to clean and improve the quality of Nashville Housing data. Nashville Housing dataset contains information about the houses in the city of Nashville including information about the owner address, property city, property state, sale date, sale price and other data.

For this project we will perform the data cleaning various tasks such as populating the values from one column to another or populate the data from the same column to get rid of the cells that does not have any value to make our data reliable and ready for analysis and visualizations.

Starting by looking at the different datatypes and which one is suitable for each column is the first thing to do in our project, we will convert some of the data types in our columns with other data types to serve us and be suitable for our use then we will start cleaning the data by populating columns with the same records in the same column or we can fill the column with values in another colums which will have the same data to get rid of missing data and NULL values.

There are columns in our dataset that have many information and look very hard to read and analyze so we will split the records in these columns in more than one column for being able to get the data from the columns effectively and easily, after that we will standardize the data in our columns by replacing values which does not meet the standard format that the column must have with the values that meet the reuired format.

Removing duplicates from the dataset is another important task in this project so we will remove the duplicates rows from our dataset then we will remove unused columns, after that we will remove unused extra spaces in the columns and finally we will assure that our data has been cleaned properly in addition to the modified columns and rows are set as we want. 

For this project, we will be using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data
